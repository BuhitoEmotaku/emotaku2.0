Welcome - <a href="https://emotaku.ddns.net/about" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Emotaku</a>üòä!!
</h1>

<h2>
Objective of web:
</h2>
<p>The reason why I made this, was to start learning VueJS and also, improve more technical skills such as: CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, WebSockets, APIS and much more!</p>
<p>Besides, I created emotaku to "unify" the emo and otaku worlds, giving both sides a nice experience</p>

### ü§ù Rules:
<p>Be nice when going in, cause there is a chat where you can conversate with other people</p>
<p>Enjoy all the stuff I have created inside.</p>
<p>The most important one: leave a little happier than you came in! ^^</p>

Enjoyy, ciaaa!
